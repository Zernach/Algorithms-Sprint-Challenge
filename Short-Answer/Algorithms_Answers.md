#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n^2)  —— one n in line one (below), and one n in line 2 (below) can be cancelled out

LINE 1 ——— while (a < n * n * n):
LINE 2 ———      a = a + n * n


b) O(log(n)) —— the amount of time diminishes due to j multiplied by two everytime


c) O(n) —— the function will linearly run as long as n is equal to
